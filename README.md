# kickstart-modular.nvim

## Introduction

*This is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that moves from a single file to a multi file configuration.*

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Modular
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
* Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
* Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
* A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  * if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
* Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
* Language Setup:
  * If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  * If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  * etc.

### Install Kickstart

> [!NOTE]
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\nvim\` |

Clone kickstart.nvim:

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> [!NOTE]
> Your fork's URL will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart-modular.nvim.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `dam9000` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart.nvim.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

The `Lazy` plugin manager will start automatically on the first run and install the configured plugins - as can be seen in the introduction video. After the installation is complete you can press `q` to close the `Lazy` UI and **you are ready to go**! Next time you run nvim `Lazy` will no longer show up.

If you would prefer to hide this step and run the plugin sync from the command line, you can use:

```sh
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```

### Recommended Steps

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo (so that you have your own copy that you can modify) and then installing you can install to your machine using the methods above.

> **NOTE**
> Your fork's url will be something like this: `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart-modular.nvim.git`

### Configuration And Extension

* Inside of your copy, feel free to modify any file you like! It's your copy!
* Feel free to change any of the default options in `init.lua` to better suit your needs.
* For adding plugins, there are 3 primary options:
  * Add new configuration in `lua/custom/plugins/*` files, which will be auto sourced using `lazy.nvim` (uncomment the line importing the `custom/plugins` directory in the `init.lua` file to enable this)
  * Modify `init.lua` with additional plugins.
  * Include the `lua/kickstart/plugins/*` files in your configuration.

You can also merge updates/changes from the repo back into your fork, to keep up-to-date with any changes for the default configuration.

#### Example: Adding an autopairs plugin

In the file: `lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua`, add:

```lua
-- File: lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua

return {
  "windwp/nvim-autopairs",
  -- Optional dependency
  dependencies = { 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' },
  config = function()
    require("nvim-autopairs").setup {}
    -- If you want to automatically add `(` after selecting a function or method
    local cmp_autopairs = require('nvim-autopairs.completion.cmp')
    local cmp = require('cmp')
    cmp.event:on(
      'confirm_done',
      cmp_autopairs.on_confirm_done()
    )
  end,
}
```

This will automatically install [windwp/nvim-autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs) and enable it on startup. For more information, see documentation for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

#### Example: Adding a file tree plugin

In the file: `lua/custom/plugins/filetree.lua`, add:

```lua
-- Unless you are still migrating, remove the deprecated commands from v1.x
vim.cmd([[ let g:neo_tree_remove_legacy_commands = 1 ]])

return {
  "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
  version = "*",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- not strictly required, but recommended
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
  },
  config = function ()
    require('neo-tree').setup {}
  end,
}
```

This will install the tree plugin and add the command `:Neotree` for you. You can explore the documentation at [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) for more information.

### Contribution

Pull-requests are welcome. The goal of this repo is not to create a Neovim configuration framework, but to offer a starting template that shows, by example, available features in Neovim. Some things that will not be included:

* Custom language server configuration (null-ls templates)
* Theming beyond a default colorscheme necessary for LSP highlight groups

Each PR, especially those which increase the line count, should have a description as to why the PR is necessary.

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing Neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:

    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```

    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information
* Why is the kickstart `init.lua` a single file? Wouldn't it make sense to split it into multiple files?
  * The main purpose of kickstart is to serve as a teaching tool and a reference
    configuration that someone can easily use to `git clone` as a basis for their own.
    As you progress in learning Neovim and Lua, you might consider splitting `init.lua`
    into smaller parts. A fork of kickstart that does this while maintaining the
    same functionality is available here:
    * [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
  * *NOTE: This is the fork that splits the configuration into smaller parts.*
    The original repo with the single `init.lua` file is available here:
    * [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
  * Discussions on this topic can be found here:
    * [Restructure the configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/218)
    * [Reorganize init.lua into a multi-file setup](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/pull/473)

### Install Recipes

Below you can find OS specific install instructions for Neovim and dependencies.

After installing all the dependencies continue with the [Install Kickstart](#install-kickstart) step.

#### Windows Installation

<details><summary>Windows with Microsoft C++ Build Tools and CMake</summary>
Installation may require installing build tools and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

* Install CMake and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```

</details>
<details><summary>Windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>
Alternatively, one can install gcc and make which don't require changing the config,
the easiest way is to use choco:

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
run in cmd as **admin**:

```
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. install all requirements using choco, exit the previous cmd and
open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:

```
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make
```
